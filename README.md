# Food Truck Business: Acai You Later

This project was for my Advanced Business Applications class in the University of Maryland Baltimore County. My team had to create a start-up restaurant themed food truck in Chincoteague Island, Additionally, we had to discuss what was currently on CI and what was missing. It was a session-long project that included Entrepreneurial activities and database development.
